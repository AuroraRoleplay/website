            <ul style="list-style: lower-latin!important; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
              <li style="list-style: lower-latin!important; margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
                <strong>FailRP</strong>
                <br>
                FailRP means failure to roleplay, when you are playing on Aurora and you break character mid session. Ask yourself questions such as “Is this possible in real life?” or “Would my character genuinely do this?”
                <br>
                <br>
                Example:
                <br>
                Doing something absolutely unreasonable or unrealistic whilst in a RP scene.
                <br>
                <br>
                First Offense: 1 day ban
                <br>
                Second Offense: 2 week ban
                <br>
                Third Offense: Permanent ban
              </li>

              <li style="list-style: lower-latin!important; margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
                <strong>NITRP</strong>
                <br>
                NITRP or No Intent to Roleplay means you join Aurora with absolutely zero intent to roleplay.
                <br>
                <br>
                Example:
                <br>
                Joining the server and immediately VDM’ing and RDM’ing people or speaking to people out of character.
                <br>
                <br>
                First Offense: 2 week ban
                <br>
                Second Offense: 30 day ban.
                <br>
                Third Offense: Permanent ban.
              </li>

              <li style="list-style: lower-latin!important; margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
                <strong>In character</strong>
                <br>
                Being In Character means to always follow roleplay, and not FailRP. Being in character includes using RP terminology such as:
                <br>
                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem;">
                <li>Server - City</li>
                <li>Discordia/Email - Discord</li>
                <li>Tsunami - Server restart</li>
                <li>Voicebox - Microphone</li>
                <li>Eyes - Screen/Look at</li>
                <li>Headpop - Game crash</li>
                <li>Flex - Click</li>
                <li>Muscle - Keyboard key</li>
                <li>Flying In/Out - Joining/Leaving</li>
                <li>Think about (something) - Type (something)</li>
                <li>Muscle spasm - Accidental click</li>
                <li>Bodycam - Clipping software</li>
                <li>In head - AFK</li>
                <li>Angel - Staff</li>
                <li>Local - NPC</li>
                <li>Lucky Number/PayPal - Your /id</li>
                <li>Headache - Lagging</li>
                </ul>
                You may not break character at any time. Even in the event of a rule break mid  scene, you must complete the scene before calling a staff member. In the event rule breaking occurs live, you still may not break character, ie. using terms such as “VDM” or “RDM.” Be sure to only use these terms in an RP situation; for example, don’t say you have bodycam footage of something if your character is wearing a T-Shirt and Jeans. Also only use these terms when necessary to try to keep players fully immersed.
                <br>
                <br>
                First Offense: Warn
                <br>
                Second Offense: Kick
                <br>
                Third Offense: Ban (7 day)
                <br>
                Fourth Offense: Ban (14 day)
                <br>
                Fifth Offense: Permanent ban
              </li>

              <li style="list-style: lower-latin!important; margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
                <strong>NLR</strong>
                <br>
                New Life Rule (NLR) is when your character fully dies in a RP scene (not bleeding out) and must be taken to the hospital. Your character will forget the last 5 minutes of what happened before their full death. NLR can be prevented by having a bodycam and RP’ing looking back at it (although you must have a reason) or somebody telling you in RP what happened.
                <br>
                <br>
                Example:
                <br>
                You get into an RP situation with somebody and you end up fully dying. In an act to get revenge, you go back to the location that you died at, find the person who killed you, and shoot them.
                <br>
                <br>
                First Offense: Kick
                <br>
                Second Offense: 2 week ban
                <br>
                Third Offense: Permanent ban
              </li>

              <li style="list-style: lower-latin!important; margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
                <strong>Fear RP</strong>
                <br>
                Fear for Life is when your character is genuinely feared for their life. Situations like this can only occur when your character is
                <br>
                Outnumbered (ie 5v1)
                <br>
                <br>
                Example: 
                “The Mafia” pulls up on your character with fully automatic rifles and your character is only armed with a knife. Despite the fact your character was outnumbered by 4, you still decided to pull out the knife and attempt to injure one of the “mafia” members.
                At gunpoint. <em>This example does not apply if your character has a holster and is capable of pulling out a gun fast.</em>
                <br>
                <br>
                First Offense: Warn
                <br>
                Second Offense: 2 week ban
                <br>
                Third Offense: Permanent ban
              </li>

              <li style="list-style: lower-latin!important; margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
                <strong>Exploiting</strong>
                <br>
                Usage of external crosshairs, cheats, modification menus or any sort of non vanilla customization to your game.
                <br>
                This rule does not apply to graphic enhancement mods such as QuantV or Natural Vision Evolved (NVE)
                This rule DOES apply to graphic dehancement modifications, such “Boost Packs” or “FPS Packs” which will make your game run significantly better at the exception of giving you an advantage in the sense that you will see less props, have brighter nights, bullet tracers, ect. This includes stretched resolution, which is unrealistic and makes player models appear bigger for an in game advantage

                <br>
                Aurora is a streamer friendly server, in which broadcasters of all kinds play it and enjoy. The <a href="https://kick.com/community-guidelines">Kick Community guidelines</a> article states that any content that is prejudice against the following is not permitted;
                <br>

                There are zero exceptions to this rule, even if you share the same ethnic origin, religion or sexual orientation as that group, or if it was “just a joke.”
                <br>

                <strong>Unrealistic Character Names</strong>
                <br>
                Aurora is a serious roleplay server in which we cannot allow names that would not happen in the real world.
                <br>
                Example:
                “Hugh Jass”, “Ben Dover”, “Hugh Janis.”
                <br>
                For roleplaying as a famous figure, such as a political leader, actor, rich individual or streamer; please contact staff beforehand.
